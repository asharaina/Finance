# Finance
Harvard CS50 PSET-9

Implementation of C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you “buy” and sell “sell” stocks by querying for stocks’ prices (air-quotes mean that it is merely a demonstration of how such a site would function - a prototype, if you will)
